You are visitor number <img src="https://profile-counter.glitch.me/gourbeyd/count.svg" />


I am Actih, a french engineer (degree from Grenoble INP - Ensimag) passionate about cybersecurity, sports and ... development.


## OffSec

I try my best to improve within the offensive security field. I'll post here write-ups of challenges I go through.

## DamsoPronos

Being a football fan, I try to build AI models to predict the outcome of football fixtures for the top 5 European Leagues. 

I built DamsoPronos, which is a project covering multiple skills:

- data scraping: get game's odds, statistics ... (python) 
- data analysis: building models to predict games outcome (python w/ tensorflow/keras)
- data presentation: [website](https://damsopronos.fr) (ReactJs) and [mobile app](https://linktr.ee/damsopronos) (available on Google Play/App Store) to show models prediction and give some advice.
